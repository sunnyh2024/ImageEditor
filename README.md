<h2>Image Editor</h2>

Hi Everyone and welcome to out Image Editor!

To use this editor, simply download the code and run the imageEditor.py file.

Note that this project is usable, there are still features that we want to implement in the future. In addition, there is no support for keystroke commands yet - everything must be clicked.

Currently, we have support for:
<ul>
    <li>loading and saving images and projects in png and hdf5 format</li>
    <li>creating new projects from images or from a blank canvas</li>
    <li>applying filters to images, including:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>blur</li>
            <li>sharpen</li>
            <li>sepia</li>
            <li>grayscale</li>
            <li>mosaic</li>
        </ul>
    <li>content-aware seam carving algorithm to downscale images</li>
    <li>adding transparent layers to images</li>
    <li>drawing with a simple brush</li>
</ul>

We are also planning to add support for the following features:
<ul>
    <li>allow users to import images as layers, and allow them to drag and drop the images to their desired location on the canvas</li>
    <li>resize the canvas view (zoom in and zoom out)</li>
    <li>both light and dark mode viewing
</ul>
